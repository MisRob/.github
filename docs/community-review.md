# Community Review

## Authors

🎉 _Thank you for your contribution! Before we assign a maintainer, we invite the open-source community to pre-review your pull request. The focus of this round is community collaboration. Be kind with each other & have fun!_ :relieved:

- Always engage with the community **respectfully and patiently**, and in line with our [Contributing guidelines](https://learningequality.org/contributing-to-our-open-code-base). Pay extra attention to [Using generative AI](https://learningequality.org/contributing-to-our-open-code-base/#using-generative-ai)—this is an opportunity to practice your own communication and collaboration skills.
- Experience levels in the community vary. **You don’t need to treat all feedback as final—discuss and clarify together. If something is unclear, just wait for a maintainer review.**

## Reviewers

🙌 _Thank you for joining the review! Based on your interest and experience, you may choose to do some or all of the following: compare the implementation with the issue requirements, run the pull request locally and confirm it works as expected, report bugs, or ask questions. If you didn’t spot any problems, give the authors a pat on the back! Be kind with each other & have fun!_ :relieved:

- Always keep in mind: **Respectful, Concise, Relevant**
- Follow our [Contributing guidelines](https://learningequality.org/contributing-to-our-open-code-base). **Pay extra attention to [Using generative AI](https://learningequality.org/contributing-to-our-open-code-base/#using-generative-ai). Avoid generic & long or otherwise AI-generated comments—they aren’t helpful and feel disrespectful to both authors and maintainers.** This is an opportunity to practice your own communication and collaboration skills.
